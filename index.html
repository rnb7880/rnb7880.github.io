			<br/>
			I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Biomedical Engineering with minors in Spanish and Computer Science. I enjoy photography, rugby, bouldering and playing piano. I am part of the slam poetry group on campus and have participated in competitions for such for the last 3 years. I really enjoy traveling, and have recently been to Costa Rica, Barcelona and Dublin. I have a cat named Lucy and a big German family. I am a creative minded person who can't hold a paintbrush to save her life, and so I attempt to use that creativity in everything else I do.

	<br/>
	I am currently looking for a full-time position following my graduation in May 2018. I am looking for engaging work within the medical field, with a focus on devices and/or software. I have experience with biofeedback and biosignal analysis (ECG, EMG, EOG etc.), working in a research lab, and in R&amp;D working as a process engineer. I am dedicated to problem solving, and believe that the best solution is always worth the hard work. I am quick learner who always welcomes a new challenge, and can take direction and also work independently.

			<div id = "proj1" class="text" > While working at Bausch &amp; Lomb, I developed a new manufacturing order sheet for the development lab. I learned VBA for Excel to do this, and produced a 6 page macro-enabled worksheet that the lab is currently using. Currently I am developing a software to use at my co-op that will be able to schedule the lab technicans based on the current projects in the lab. This is currently being written in VBA for Excel, but I hope to translate the logic to Java.

			<div id = "proj2"  class="text" > For BrickHacks, a hackathon at RIT, I worked with my brother and a friend on an android application that took information from a parking lot and would tell the user the best open space to park in. I dealt with the algorithms to find the most efficient open parking space.

			<div id = "proj3"  class="text" > I participated in a workshop called the Dynamics of Excitable Systems in January 2017. We studied the electrical system of the heart including how to model it mathematically. We explored chaos and the disruption of electrical flow. We also dissected a sheep's heart to learn anatomy. You can see our work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQnFzTT7Ioc">here.</a>

			<div class="mySlides">
			<div id = "proj4"  class="text" > I used MATLAB and self-taught Max/MSP to analyze ECG data to detect Atrial Fibrillation. I collected signals from Physionet and simulated signal. I completed an IRB process and tested the program on participants. The work was presented Undergraduate Research Symposium at RIT.
