		WHO AM I
		<br/><br/>
		I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Biomedical Engineering with minors in Spanish and Computer Science. I enjoy photography, rugby, bouldering and playing piano. I am part of the slam poetry group on campus and have participated in competitions for such for the last 3 years. I really enjoy traveling, and have recently been to Costa Rica, Barcelona and Dublin. I have a cat named Lucy and a big German family. I am a creative minded person who can't hold a paintbrush to save her life, and so I attempt to use that creativity in everything else I do.

	<td class="colorblock" style= "background-color: rgba(244, 159, 10, 0.7)">PROJECTS
	<br/><br/>
	-While working at Bausch &amp; Lomb, I developed a new manufacturing order sheet for the development lab. I learned VBA for Excel to do this, and produced a 6 page macro-enabled worksheet that the lab is currently using.
	<br/>
	-For BrickHacks, a hackathon at RIT, I worked with my brother and a friend on an android application that took information from a parking lot and would tell the user the best open space to park in. I dealt with the algorithms to find the most efficient open parking space. You can view that project at ____.
	<br/>
	-Currently I am developing a software to use at my co-op that will be able to schedule the lab technicans based on the current projects in the lab. This is currently being written in VBA for Excel, but I hope to translate the logic to Java.
