		WHO AM I
		<br/><br/>
		I am a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Biomedical Engineering with minors in Spanish and Computer Science. I enjoy photography, rugby, bouldering and playing piano. I am part of the slam poetry group on campus and have participated in competitions for such for the last 3 years. I really enjoy traveling, and have recently been to Costa Rica, Barcelona and Dublin. I have a cat named Lucy and a big German family. I am a creative minded person who can't hold a paintbrush to save her life, and so I attempt to use that creativity in everything else I do.
