<div id = "proj1" style="display:none"> "In February of 2016 I attended the WIC (Women in Computing) Hackathon at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I worked with a team of 4 other girls, including my sister, to produce Codefucious. The project descriptions were to create soltutions to issues with women around the world, or to teach programming to kids. We decided to tackle both with a Free-Rice inspired site that taught children to code, and in turn would donate money to a microp-load site like KIVA.org to help women worldwide. You can find our project at <a href= "http://devpost.com/software/codefucious" style="color: #614b7f" target="_blank"> the devpost page </a> and explore what we created."

<div id = "proj2" style="display:none"> "For my work at Girls Who Code, we were supposed to go through the projects that would be assigned throughout the summer so we were prepared to teach.I got a bit hooked into the Jukebox project for Scratch and made what I thought was a fairly decent jukebox. I love music and so being able to play with this even for a little while was refreshing. To see the project visit ____ and feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions to improve it!"

<div id = "proj3" style="display:none"> "When I was in High School I participated in the Personal Authority and Leadership Seminiar (PAaLS) project to make a documentary about women leaders in the world and what troubles they have faced in their careers. What started out as a simple project on phone interviews quickly turned into something big for us, working with amazing people to really find the answers to the questions we had. We talked about issues like being called a b****, work-life balance, mentorship, conquering fears and finding passion. To see the trailer or documentary in full, please visit <a href="http://www.misshalls.org/Page/Girls-Leadership/Girls-Leadership-Project/A-Seat-at-the-Table---A-Documentary" style="color: #614b7f" target="_blank">the project's site.</a>

<div id = "proj4" style="display:none"> "A new project, I found that keeping track of my purchase on mutliple cards, credit and debit, while also trying to save up for travel was a bit difficult. Even with my love for excel, some things just remain complicated. So I started making CardCovers. CardCovers are slips for a credit card that on one side have space to write out expense details such as amount and store, and on the other side show an image of something I am saving up for. For instance, the first one I made has a library-card style place for the info, with a picture of a stamp for Rome on the other. This has helped me be more cconscientious with my purchases, and realize just how much I am spending. Now I just need to make an equivalent for online spending."

<div id = "proj5" style="display:none"> "Still in concept stages, I am trying to make an add-on to Google Drive that will take in information via a form, and will append it to the top of a google document of your choosing in a template specific to the document. This was inspired by the journals my students made everyday when I was working for Girls Who Code. I thought it would be easier and more organized than several individual documents with different names and dates. We shall see how far I get. If you are interested in helping me with this project, please shoot me a message via my <a href = "websitecontact.html" style="color: #614b7f">Contact Page</a>"

<div id = "proj6" style="display:none"> "My very first project in python. I made a battleship game, sparked by a very basic one on Code Academy where I learned python. My game was originally written in 2.7 and has since been updated to 3.4. You can see my code and play a game by going to my <a href =  "https://github.com/rnb7880/Battleship/" style="color: #614b7f" target="_blank">github repository</a> for the project."
</div>

<div id = "proj7" style="display:none"> 'Another project inspired by Girls Who Code, we had a project for the students that required making a so-called "Runner" Game. This is really just a sprite collecting game, but it was found to be pretty difficult to finish by both the teachers and the students. I spent more time than I truly wanted to working on it, but finally figured it out and couldn't help but play around with it a bit and have fun. If you want to see this please visit <a href =  "https://github.com/rnb7880/Runner/" style="color: #614b7f" target="_blank">my github repository</a> for the project, where you can see it and also follow instructions to be able to play it.'
